# Terminology Map — Mirror Path Cybernetics

This document stabilizes language across the manuscript.

Each term is defined by:
- **Function**, not belief
- **What question it answers**
- **Which model it belongs to**

This prevents drift and category errors.

## Core Structural Terms

### Baseline
- **Function:** Stable reference state of the system
- **Answers:** “Where am I starting from?”
- **Model:** Four Foundations (Training)
- **Notes:** Baseline is not pleasant or ideal — only stable.

---

### Drift
- **Function:** Unnoticed movement away from baseline
- **Answers:** “Is the system escalating or collapsing?”
- **Model:** Training & Regulation
- **Notes:** Drift is detected before crisis.

---

### Gain
- **Function:** Intensity applied to a signal or formation
- **Answers:** “How strongly is this being amplified?”

- **Notes:** Gain is scalar (0–10), not moral.

---

### Craving
- **Function:** Application of gain to a formation
- **Answers:** “Why is this pulling me?”
- **Model:** Control / Dependent Origination
- **Notes:** Appears as tension and tightness.

---

### Aversion
- **Function:** Directional gain opposing a formation
- **Answers:** “Why am I resisting?”
- **Model:** Control
- **Notes:** Same mechanism as craving; different direction.

---

## Training & Orientation Terms

### Four Foundations
- **Function:** Safe order for learning attention
- **Answers:** “Where do I look first?”
- **Model:** Training / Stability
- **Order:** Body → Feeling → Mind → Screen

---

### Relaxation
- **Function:** Withdrawal of unnecessary gain
- **Answers:** “What happens if I stop pushing?”

---

### Up-Regulation / Down-Regulation

- **Model:** Control
- **Notes:** Uses different tools depending on direction.

---

## Signal Stratification Terms

### Body (Mechanical)
- **Function:** Actuated substrate
- **Answers:** “What is physically happening?”
- **Model:** Signal Stratification
- **Includes:** Posture, movement, tension

---

### Chemistry (Affective)
- **Function:** Hormonal / visceral tone
- **Answers:** “Why does this feel pleasant or unpleasant?”
- **Model:** Signal Stratification
- **Notes:** Body-origin signal, not thought.

---

### Energy (Interface Tone)
- **Function:** Global contraction, expansion, buzz
- **Answers:** “What is the system’s overall tone?”
- **Model:** Signal Stratification
- **Notes:** Screen-level, not bodily.

---

### Content
- **Function:** Symbolic representation
- **Answers:** “What story or image is present?”
- **Model:** Signal Stratification
- **Notes:** Includes thoughts, narration, imagery.

---

## Interface Terms

### Screen
- **Function:** Total field of experience
- **Answers:** “Where does everything appear?”
- **Model:** Interface
- **Notes:** Not a place, but a presentation surface.

---

### Formation
- **Function:** Interactive element on the screen
- **Answers:** “Where can gain be applied?”
- **Model:** Interface / Control
- **Notes:** Different from labels or meanings.

---

### Press “A” to Continue
- **Function:** Sustained permission for action
- **Answers:** “How does action unfold?”
- **Model:** Agency / Control
- **Notes:** Action is permission, not command.

---

## Identity & Integration Terms

### Ego
- **Function:** Self-referencing engine
- **Answers:** “How does experience get centralized?”
- **Model:** Cognitive / Interface
- **Notes:** Directional process, not an entity.

---

### Misidentification
- **Function:** Confusing a process with “me”
- **Answers:** “Why does this feel personal?”
- **Model:** Integration
- **Notes:** Can occur at any layer.

---

### Witness
- **Function:** Stable orientation point
- **Answers:** “What notices without acting?”
- **Model:** Orientation
- **Notes:** Not an agent, not a self.

---

### Agency
- **Function:** Gain modulation before execution
- **Answers:** “Where does choice actually occur?”
- **Model:** Control
- **Notes:** Quiet, optional, non-identity-based.

---

## Safety & Ethics

### Ahimsa
- **Function:** Non-harm applied inwardly
- **Answers:** “How do I explore safely?”
- **Model:** Ethics / Safety
- **Notes:** Skill before destabilization.

---

### Stability
- **Function:** Ability to hold a state over time
- **Answers:** “Is this usable?”
- **Model:** Training
- **Notes:** Not intensity.

---

## Closing Note

Terms in this map are **functional placeholders**.

They exist to:
- reduce confusion
- prevent metaphysical drift
- support safe exploration

If a term stops being useful, it can be revised.

The system comes first.
Language serves it.
