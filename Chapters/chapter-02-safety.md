Chapter 2

Baseline and the First Safety Skill

Student:
What is baseline?

Teacher:
Baseline is a snapshot of a stable moment in your system.

It is not:

perfect

pain-free

peaceful

pleasant


It is simply this:

> “This is how things are right now, when nothing is being pushed.”



If you have neuropathy, baseline includes neuropathy.
If you’re tired, baseline includes tiredness.

Baseline is not what should be there.
Baseline is what is there when the system is not escalating or collapsing.


---

Student:
Where do we first learn to recognize baseline?

Teacher:
In the body and in feeling.

Early on, most reference cues are somatic:

muscle tension

breath quality

posture

heaviness or lightness

pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral tone


These are domain-specific signals.
Later, they become objects of mind.

But at the beginning, the body is the dashboard.


---

Student:
What is the first actual skill?

Teacher:
Returning to baseline.

Not finding bliss.
Not stopping thoughts.
Not insight.

Just this:

> Can I leave baseline — and come back?



If you cannot return, you do not yet have control.
You only have drift.


---

Student:
How do we test that safely?

Teacher:
With relaxation.

Relaxation is not a goal.
It is a diagnostic maneuver.

Here is the rule:

If you relax and the system stabilizes → you were over-energized

If you relax and the system collapses → you were under-energized


Relaxation tells you which direction you were drifting.


---

Student:
What does “relax” mean here?

Teacher:
Withdrawing unnecessary effort.

soften muscles

ease the breath

stop forcing attention

let the system show you what it does next


Then you watch.

Do not fix.
Do not judge.
Do not improve.

Observe.


---

Student:
What if the system collapses when I relax?

Teacher:
Then relaxation was not the right move at that moment.

This is not failure.

It means:

energy is too low

interest has dropped below zero

the system needs gentle engagement, not withdrawal


Up-regulating skills exist, but they are not practiced yet.

For now:

stop

return to ordinary activity

restore baseline externally



---

Student:
What loop are we learning here?

Teacher:
A simple one:

1. Stare — establish a reference


2. Breathe — circulate without forcing


3. Relax — withdraw gain and observe


4. Return — see whether baseline reappears



This is a down-regulation loop.

It is how you learn the terrain safely.

Later, the same loop inverts.


---

Student:
Why all this caution?

Teacher:
Because learning requires destabilization.

And destabilization without safety causes harm.

Every serious discipline learned this the hard way:

test pilots

radiation researchers

early surgeons


The ethical rule is simple:

> Learn how to be safe before you break things.



This is ahimsa, applied to inner exploration.


---

Student:
How long should I stay with this?

Teacher:
Until baseline becomes boring.

Until you can:

find it

leave it

return to it


Without drama.

That is the first real power.
